        <h1>Focus on the progress the customer wants to make</h1>
        <p>Jobs Theory centres around the idea that when you are designing or marketing a product or services, you want to focus on the progress the customer wants to make over the use or the product its self. The classic example in Jobs theory is an electric drill. The product is the drill. The use is drilling holes in a wall. The progress is hanging a picture and as an extension living in a beautifully decorated home. Designing and then marketing a product on he progress the customer want (the job) means the product is a perfect fit for the customer’s job and it’s easy for the customer to see the benefit.</p>

        <p>A well-defined job offers a kind of innovation blueprint. It provides clear guidance for companies looking to grow through innovation. It reframes competition beyond the typically defined category boundaries. At its heart, Jobs-to-be-Done Theory explains why customers pull certain products and services into their lives and describe the progress they are trying to make. And this, in turn, explains why some innovations are successful and others are not.</p>

        <h1>A repeatable method to understand how to create and sell things people love</h1>
        <p>Jobs-to-be-Done is a tool you use when you want to innovate a product or design a marketing strategy. It provides a repeatable method to understand how to create and sell things people love. Jobs-to-be-Done research is all about tracing this journey, understanding the competing forces, considerations and context. It’s about understanding what we can do as product designers and marketers to nudge the customer to our solution. It’s about uncovering the Job description that we write for ourselves, every-time we choose to consume a product.</p>

        <h1>Stable, boundless and solution agnostic</h1>
        <p>A properly uncovered Job to be Done has three important traits. It’s these three traits that make Jobs theory so powerful.</p>

        <p><b>A job is stable. It doesn’t change over time.</b> How a job is solved changes over time. The delivery method or technology changes. The Job to be Done is timeless. Take for example communication. History has seen letters, telegrams, emails, SMS, and chat applications. The Job of communicating a message to another person hasn’t changed, the technology has evolved to allow us to do it faster and in realtime over vast distance. The job is a stable focal point around which to create customer value.</p>

        <p><b>A job has no geographical or demographically boundaries.</b> No matter if a person lives in China, Australia or the US. If they are rich, middle class or poor, they will have many jobs in common that they are trying to get done. The solutions to how they get a Job done may be dramatically different, but the desired progress is always the same. For example, if I need to meet a person, how I arrive at the meeting might be completely different, however, the desired progress is exactly the same. No matter if I catch a bus, cab, Uber, drive, walk or decide to Skype, the desired progress is the same.</p>

        <p><b>A job is solution agnostic.</b> As the first two traits have already highlighted, a Job to be Done can have multiple different solutions that provide customers with a way to progress. Once properly defined, this is what opens the door to true innovation. Once you understand customers struggles and desired progress, you can design a targeted solution that gets the Job done better, cheaper, faster, easier, and/or more succinctly.</p>
