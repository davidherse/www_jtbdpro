# Jobs-to-be-Done example Workshop Interview Script 

Jobs-to-be-Done example Workshop Interview Script 

A good way to think about this is that we are literally filming a documentary. We want all the details around when you first started thinking about buying [x]. When you made the decision and experiencing it for the first time. We’ll ask really broad questions and then there will be occasions where we will slow down time. Ask you questions about where you and were who you with – dive really deep into the detail. It’s a funny method. But bear with us and you’ll see how it all comes together

- When did you purchase the product?
- Where were you? 
- Where did you buy it?
- How did you buy it?
- Did you buy anything else with it (Set the scene to help pull back the memories and spot associations)
- What time of day was it? (daytime/ nighttime?)
- Was anyone else with you at the time?
- How did you purchase the product?

**Note: Now we can start working backwards, we are looking for the spark - finding the first thought.**

- Where were you?
- Were you with someone? 
- What did they say?
- What triggered you to think about this?

**Note: We are looking for when they were passively looking and what happened to switch to active looking? What were the events? What was the timeline? Sometime you’ll find that people say when they first started looking, and as you dive deeper they push that event back. When they realise they were passively looking much earlier than they thought.**

**What’s the emotion? Are they worried about the features? In the interview, make sure you stick to what happened. Speculating with the interviewee will not give you any real insights.**

**Now we start moving forward. Building the consideration set. Understand the options they looked at. Why did they discount them? What are the anxieties? The push and pulls. What were they willing to trade off. Money, time, convenience?**

- Tell me about how you looked for a product to solve your problem.
- What kind of solutions did you try? Or not try? Why or why not?
- Who did you talk to about this?

**Note:  Be curious about emotion**

- What was the conversation like when you talked about purchasing the product with your (spouse/friend/parents)?
- Before you purchased did you imagine what life would be like with the product? Where were you when you were thinking about this?
- Did you have any anxiety about the purchase? Did you hear something about the product that made you nervous? What was it? - Why did it make you nervous?

**Note: The key thing is to follow the story and piece it together. Improvise – find out the story!**

**If you get time, talk about what happened after the purchase. People have a set of expectations on how that hire will change their life, To ease the struggle. Help them progress.** 

- Did the product meet your exceptions? 
- How are you using the product now? 

**Note: Are they using it for the original purpose (the big hire) are they adapting it for other purposes (the little hire). Look carefully at the little hires. This is where opportunities to innovate can surface.**

- So, you got the product, has it meet your expectations?
– Are you using it for original intent
– Are you using it for anything you did expect to be using it for?

**Note: Avoid connecting the wrong dots. The only information you can pay attention to are the things that happened. Anything that is along the lines of speculation should be struck out. That is not how the person behaved, it’s speculation on how they might have behaved in a given circumstance.**

**Keep an open mind. As people tell you their story, they will unlock the memory of events. They remember new things and correct something they said earlier. They’ll start to use better language as they form a better picture of events. Make sure you allow this to happen.**

**Avoid Psychological evaluation. Sometimes it’s easy to dive into the psychological aspect of an individual. Make sure you steer the conversation towards the facts and interactions of the events. Less so on the broader personality of the person. Psychological evaluation slips into the world of speculation. It doesn’t represent what happened.**

**Unlocking memories people will often not remember the details of purchase straight away. But you can help unlock mommies by asking the question around the event in questions. What days was it? Where where you. Who else was there? What else did you buy? What was the weather like. What was on TV. These questions are not directly relevant necessarily to the events, but it will help put the person in the moment and unlock other details that are important.**

**Pause and recant. Summing up. Sometime in the interview process it good to appear a little dump about the events the person is describing. Say things like. I don’t quite understand. Can you explain that more to me? This will trigger people to retell the situation with different language and more details. Often unlocking new insight. Another thing you can do is recant the story but purposely get a few things wrong. This will cause the person to retell the correct story in more detail.**
